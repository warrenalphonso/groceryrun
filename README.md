# Instructions

Use `A` and `D` to move left and right. `W` to jump. Your goal it to collect 15
toilet paper rolls without getting infected. Every time you come in contact
with a customer, you lose a life and your mask strength is decreased. Beware the
other customers: they're not as concerned about social distancing as you are.
Once you lose all protection and get infected, it's game over.
